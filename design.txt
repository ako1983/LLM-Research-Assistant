# High-Level Design for LLM Agent Implementation

The LLM agent needs to make intelligent decisions about how to respond to user queries, with three main capabilities:
1. Answering directly from its knowledge
2. Using the RAG system to enhance responses
3. Calling external tools when necessary

Let's break down the components and implementation steps required:

## Agent Architecture Components

### 1. Query Router
This is the decision-making core of your agent that determines how to handle each query.

- **Purpose**: Analyze the incoming query and decide the appropriate response strategy
- **Functionality**:
  - Classify queries as "direct knowledge" (general knowledge questions), "research needed" (specific or detailed questions), or "tool required" (calculations, external data needs)
  - Route the query to the appropriate response generator

### 2. Direct Knowledge Responder
This handles queries that can be answered without external context.

- **Purpose**: Generate responses for general knowledge questions
- **Functionality**:
  - Formulate prompts for the LLM that encourage it to use its built-in knowledge
  - Include appropriate system instructions to guide the LLM's response format and depth

### 3. RAG-Enhanced Responder
This leverages your existing RAG pipeline for context-enriched responses.

- **Purpose**: Generate responses that require specific information from your document collection
- **Functionality**:
  - Call your retrieval system to get relevant document chunks
  - Create augmented prompts that include the retrieved context
  - Instruct the LLM to synthesize information from the retrieved documents

### 4. Tool Caller
This component manages external tool usage.

- **Purpose**: Execute calculations, API calls, or other external operations
- **Functionality**:
  - Identify what tool is needed based on the query
  - Format the query appropriately for the tool
  - Execute the tool call and retrieve results
  - Integrate tool results into the final response

### 5. Multi-Step Reasoning Coordinator
This implements chain-of-thought processes across the agent.

- **Purpose**: Enable complex reasoning across multiple steps
- **Functionality**:
  - Break down complex queries into sequential reasoning steps
  - Track the state of reasoning across multiple LLM calls
  - Synthesize a final response from the reasoning chain

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Design the Query Router Logic
1. Create a classification prompt that helps the LLM determine the appropriate response type
2. Implement the routing logic that directs the query to the appropriate component
3. Test with diverse query types to ensure proper classification

### Step 2: Implement Direct Knowledge Response Generation
1. Design the system prompt for direct knowledge response
2. Create a function that constructs the full prompt and calls the LLM
3. Implement error handling and response validation

### Step 3: Integrate RAG Pipeline with Response Generation
1. Connect your existing RAG system to the agent framework
2. Design prompts that effectively incorporate retrieved context
3. Implement a response generation function that uses retrieved documents

### Step 4: Develop Tool Integration Framework
1. Identify essential tools to implement (calculator, web search, etc.)
2. Create a standardized interface for tool calls
3. Implement individual tool connectors
4. Develop a system for incorporating tool outputs into responses

### Step 5: Build Multi-Step Reasoning System
1. Design a state management system for tracking reasoning steps
2. Create prompts that encourage step-by-step thinking
3. Implement functions for chaining multiple reasoning steps
4. Develop a method for synthesizing the final response

### Step 6: Integrate All Components
1. Create a unified agent class that orchestrates all components
2. Implement the main query handling flow
3. Add logging and debugging capabilities
4. Test with complex queries that require multiple capabilities

## Implementation with LangChain/LangGraph

Since you're considering LangChain/LangGraph for the tools integration, here's how you might structure the implementation:

### LangGraph Implementation Approach

1. **Define Nodes**: Create separate nodes for:
   - Query classification
   - Direct knowledge response
   - RAG retrieval and response
   - Tool selection
   - Tool execution
   - Response synthesis

2. **Define Edges**: Create the connections between nodes that define the possible paths through your agent's reasoning process

3. **State Management**: Define a state object that tracks:
   - Original query
   - Classification results
   - Retrieved documents (if any)
   - Tool outputs (if any)
   - Intermediate reasoning steps
   - Final response

4. **Graph Construction**: 
   - Build a directed graph connecting the nodes according to your decision logic
   - Implement conditional routing based on classification results

## Code Structure Outline


## Next Steps

1. **Design your query classification system**: Start by implementing the QueryRouter that can distinguish between the three types of queries.

2. **Implement basic direct response functionality**: Create the simplest response path first, which is answering from the model's knowledge.

3. **Connect your existing RAG pipeline**: Integrate your ChromaDB retriever with the research response generation.

4. **Start with a simple tool implementation**: Begin with a calculator tool as your first external tool integration.

5. **Test each component incrementally**: Build and test one component at a time before moving to the next.

6. **Finally, implement the multi-step reasoning**: Once the basic paths are working, enhance with step-by-step reasoning.
